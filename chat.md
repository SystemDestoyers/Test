# JADCO Vue Project - Implementation Notes

## Overview of Changes

This document summarizes the key changes and discussions made during the development of the JADCO Vue project.

## Conditional Asset Loading Implementation

We implemented a system to conditionally load `services.js` and `services.css` assets based on the current route:

1. Created a mechanism in App.vue to:
   - Detect when the user is on pages other than Home
   - Dynamically load/unload service-related assets
   - Properly initialize service components after loading

2. Fixed an issue where assets were loading on Home.vue by:
   - Enhancing route detection with immediate checking
   - Adding cleanup for services assets when returning to Home
   - Improving logging to track route changes

3. Fixed visibility issues when switching pages:
   - Added proper initialization timing for assets
   - Created cleanup code to reset element visibility 
   - Ensured script initialization via both DOM events and jQuery events

## Educational Services Section Fix

Fixed the educational services section that wasn't working correctly:

1. Discovered that static.js only initializes once on page load in SPAs
2. Moved the educational services initialization code from static.js to Home.vue
3. Used Vue lifecycle hooks to ensure proper initialization
4. Replaced jQuery with native JavaScript for better Vue integration

## Service Pages Enhancement

Updated all service page components to match the structure from the Blade templates:

1. Migrated complete HTML structure from Blade templates to Vue components
2. Added proper section styling and layout matching the original design
3. Implemented service hero sections with correct image placement
4. Created detailed service features lists with proper formatting
5. Added call-to-action sections with router links
6. Removed references to missing components (StemEducation, K12InternationalSchools)

## Hybrid Routing Approach

Implemented a hybrid routing solution:

1. Modified Laravel routes to:
   - Use the Blade template for the home page
   - Use the Vue SPA for all other routes

2. Updated Vue Router to remove the home route

3. Modified the Navbar component to:
   - Use regular <a> tags for home navigation
   - Keep router-link for SPA routes
   - Add special handling for the "Let's Talk" button 

## Benefits of the Approach

1. **Performance**: Home page loads faster without the Vue overhead
2. **Flexibility**: Maintains the original Blade template for Home
3. **UX**: Other pages benefit from SPA navigation without page reloads
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between Blade and Vue pages
5. **SEO**: Home page can be easily optimized for search engines

## File Changes Summary

1. **App.vue**: Added services asset loading/unloading logic
2. **Home.vue**: Added direct initialization for educational services section
3. **Service components**: Completely restructured to match Blade templates
4. **routes.js**: Removed home route and references to missing components
5. **web.php**: Updated Laravel routes for the hybrid approach
6. **Navbar.vue**: Modified to handle both types of navigation

## Future Considerations

1. Consider using the same hybrid approach for service detail pages
2. Further optimize asset loading for SPA routes
3. Add client-side caching for better performance
4. Implement more comprehensive error handling
5. Add loading indicators between route transitions
